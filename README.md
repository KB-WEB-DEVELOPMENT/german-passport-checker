# Project Description

This PHP 8.0 package determines if a PHP variable of the data type "string" matches the current "**serial number part**" present on all German ID cards and German passports.

The serial number part format follows the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) guidelines and makes it MRZ (machine-readable zone) compliant.

Note that since November 1, 2007, the serial number part contains **9 characters** and **one checksum digit** (10 characters in total).

<ins>**A) Initial constraints**</ins>

To deal with all the changes over time, my code reflects the three time segments I worked with:


Time segment #1: 01.11.2007 - 31.10.2021

Time segment #2: 01.11.2021 - 31.10.2023 

Time segment #3: 01.11.2023 - ongoing ...

<ins>**B) Additional constraint**</ins>
